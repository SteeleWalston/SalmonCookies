                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hi! Pat here, all the way from Seattle! I’ve combined two signature Seattle icons, salmon and coffee, and started a super successful business. I’ve developed a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies. My shops are did so well in Seattle that now we’ve expanded to Portland!

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Pat’s Salmon Cookies all started a few years back when I realized my beautiful family loves to bake all the time! So we came up with a unique recipe, the cookies are made into the shape of a salmon, and are actually made with salmon (though the fish is ground up so fine that you can't even taste it!).They are the ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a PNW morning. Or PNW afternoon... whatever. Portland tourists will go gaga for them, locals will begrudgingly fall in love with them, and I will make a ton more money.</p>
